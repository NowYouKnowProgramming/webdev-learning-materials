### Tailwind CSS

<details>
<summary>Dynamic variants without using third-party library (like CVA or tw.classed)</summary>

![Tweet with description: "Have found this to be a pretty effective lightweight strategy for managing variants using clsx vs needing to reach for cva or tailwind variants: code snippet showing classes being applied to an element based on keys from packages."](/images/css/tailwind_variants.png)

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0rxJXwnHLY?si=O258GEUXPZte37tr" loading="lazy"></iframe>

#### The most important highlights

##### Difference between a single class (BEM approach) and the atomic approach (tailwind):

The classname "tells" you **what kind of component it is** (e.g., whether it's a card or a container), but **it doesn't give you implementation details** (i.e., what styles it's made up of), while Tailwind gives you the **details of the implementation**, but **doesn't illustrate what the component represents**.

##### Cons of Tailwind

<p> - Debugging in the browser because there isn't a single specific class (this can be circumvented by using the devtools of a specific framework and searching by components). Additionally, dynamically adding a new attribute is difficult (this can be circumvented using external devtools like <a href="https://tailscan.com/">https://tailscan.com/</a>, <a href="https://www.inspectflow.io/">https://www.inspectflow.io/</a>, or <a href="https://devtoolsfortailwind.com/">https://devtoolsfortailwind.com/</a>).</p>

<br />

<p>- Reading the classes alone doesn't provide specific information compared to regular CSS.</p></p>

<br />

<p>- It won't be suitable everywhere. For example, in a project where only HTML, CSS, and JS are used, Tailwind will be a poor solution.</p>

<br />

<p>- Since v3, the addition of dynamic classes has been significantly limited, e.g., <code>bg-{color}-500</code> won't work anymore (this can be bypassed by loading the entire Tailwind via CDN, which significantly increases the project bundle).</p>

<br />

<p>- Tailwind users tend to write non-semantic HTML - this can be prevented by using a11y analysis tools.</p>

<br />

An alternative approach to Tailwind towards type safety - for those who want to be sure there will be no typos and want the styles to be modular and extensible as in CSS Modules.

Drawbacks - the syntax isn't as convenient, but it's a matter of getting used to.
