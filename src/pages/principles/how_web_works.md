After some time working with web development, you will start to wonder how the web works. The underlying technologies that make the web possible. How the browser communicates with the server, and how the server communicates with the database and other services. On this page we are gathering resources that will help you this topic.

## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are a way to communicate with the client the status of the request. For example, if the request was successful, or if there was an error. You can find a list of all the HTTP status codes [here - MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

Here is a [video from Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJa5CTIFj7U) that explains the HTTP status codes.

A more bare bones version of list of HTTP status codes can be found [here on www.restapitutorial.com](https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html).
